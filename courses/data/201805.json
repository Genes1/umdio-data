All evaluations have weaknesses, and some have more weaknesses than others.  You will learn how to distinguish high from low quality evaluations.  We will discuss the basic economics and econometrics of program evaluation, focusing on the application of methods used for causal inference and cost-benefit analyses in public policy contexts.  We will examine published evaluation research with the intent of showing how the research does or does not lead to clear conclusions regarding program performance.","grading_method":["Regular","Audit"],"gen_ed":[],"core":[],"relationships":{"coreqs":null,"prereqs":"ECON641 and ECON645.","formerly":null,"restrictions":null,"additional_info":null,"also_offered_as":null,"credit_granted_for":null},"sections":[{"section_id":"ECON672-PR01","semester":"201805","number":"PR01","seats":"19","meetings":[{"days":"W","room":"","building":"TBA","end_time":"9:30pm","classtype":"","start_time":"6:45pm"},{"days":"","room":"ONLINE","building":"","end_time":"","classtype":"Discussion","start_time":""}],"open_seats":"4","waitlist":"0","instructors":["Ryan Nunn"],"course":"ECON672"},{"section_id":"ECON672-PRCM","semester":"201805","number":"PRCM","seats":"5","meetings":[{"days":"W","room":"","building":"TBA","end_time":"9:30pm","classtype":"","start_time":"6:45pm"},{"days":"","room":"ONLINE","building":"","end_time":"","classtype":"Discussion","start_time":""}],"open_seats":"2","waitlist":"0","instructors":["Ryan Nunn"],"course":"ECON672"}]},{"course_id":"ECON684","semester":"201805","name":"Applied Time Series Analysis and Forecasting","dept_id":"ECON","department":"Economics","credits":"3","description":"This course builds on the brief introduction to time series econometrics offered in ECON 645.
