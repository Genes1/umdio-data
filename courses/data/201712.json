The class will culminate with a capstone project in which students will apply the analysis methods they have learned to understanding a particular question about social networks and social media.","grading_method":["Regular"],"gen_ed":[],"core":[],"relationships":{"coreqs":null,"prereqs":null,"formerly":"LBSC708L.","restrictions":"Permission of INFO-College of Information Studies.","additional_info":null,"also_offered_as":null,"credit_granted_for":"LBSC708L or INST633."},"sections":[{"section_id":"INST633-WB11","semester":"201712","number":"WB11","seats":"25","meetings":[{"days":"","room":"ONLINE","building":"","end_time":"","classtype":"","start_time":""}],"open_seats":"1","waitlist":"0","instructors":["Jennifer Golbeck"],"course":"INST633"}]},{"course_id":"INST641","semester":"201712","name":"Policy and Ethics in Digital Curation","dept_id":"INST","department":"Information Studies","credits":"3","description":"Discussion of strategies to address intellectual property, privacy, security and other policy and ethics concerns raised by the curation of digital records and data.","grading_method":["Regular"],"gen_ed":[],"core":[],"relationships":{"coreqs":null,"prereqs":"INST604; or INST640; or permission of instructor.","formerly":null,"restrictions":"Permission of INFO-College of Information Studies.","additional_info":null,"also_offered_as":null,"credit_granted_for":null},"sections":[{"section_id":"INST641-WB11","semester":"201712","number":"WB11","seats":"25","meetings":[{"days":"","room":"ONLINE","building":"","end_time":"","classtype":"","start_time":""}],"open_seats":"16","waitlist":"0","instructors":["Adam Kriesberg"],"course":"INST641"}]},{"course_id":"INST670","semester":"201712","name":"Introduction to Javascript Programming","dept_id":"INST","department":"Information Studies","credits":"1","description":"Introduction to the fundamentals of Javascript programming.

Films to be screened may include Seven Samurai, The Wild Bunch, Ringo and His Golden Pistol, Once Upon a Time in China, Star Wars,  Point Break, Saving Private Ryan, Deep Impact, Spy Kids, Jurassic Park, Breakdown, Enter the Dragon, Hard-Boiled, Run Lola Run, La Femme Nikita, Last Action Hero, Salt, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, The  Peacemaker, The Matrix, District 13, and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The course will pay attention to female film makers as well as action films featuring female leads. Through these screenings in conjunction with critical writings by established and young scholars in film studies and cultural studies, we hope to explore the historical, esthetic, generic, institutional, and political significance of these films. We also hope to touch upon questions of national identity, gender, class,  heroism, and ethnicity as well as ways of the spectators engagement with the action body and the action narrative.","grading_method":["Regular","Pass-Fail","Audit"],"gen_ed":[],"core":[],"relationships":{"coreqs":null,"prereqs":null,"formerly":null,"restrictions":null,"additional_info":null,"also_offered_as":null,"credit_granted_for":null},"sections":[{"section_id":"SLLC368D-WB11","semester":"201712","number":"WB11","seats":"30","meetings":[{"days":"","room":"ONLINE","building":"","end_time":"","classtype":"","start_time":""}],"open_seats":"30","waitlist":"0","instructors":["Jason Kuo"],"course":"SLLC368D"}]},{"course_id":"SLLC368E","semester":"201712","name":"Special Topics in Film Studies I; Jim Henson: Art, Media, Muppets","dept_id":"SLLC","department":"School of Languages, Literatures and Cultures","credits":"3","description":"This course follows the professional and artistic life of Jim Henson to analyze major changes that have occurred in international media from the 1950s through the 1990s.","grading_method":["Regular","Pass-Fail","Audit"],"gen_ed":[],"core":[],"relationships":{"coreqs":null,"prereqs":null,"formerly":null,"restrictions":null,"additional_info":null,"also_offered_as":null,"credit_granted_for":null},"sections":[{"section_id":"SLLC368E-WB11","semester":"201712","number":"WB11","seats":"30","meetings":[{"days":"","room":"ONLINE","building":"","end_time":"","classtype":"","start_time":""}],"open_seats":"30","waitlist":"0","instructors":["Brian Real"],"course":"SLLC368E"}]},{"course_id":"SOCY100","semester":"201712","name":"Introduction to Sociology","dept_id":"SOCY","department":"Sociology","credits":"3","description":"The fundamental concepts and principles of sociology.
